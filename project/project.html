            <p>Have you seen videos of people making shirts at home? Well, it is definitely possible, and you can make that happen as well in only a few steps. First, let’s talk about the most common and popular methods to achieve this. Let’s start with Heat Transfer Vinyl (HTV), which is beginner-friendly and has minimal upfront cost. This is perfect if you don’t know anything about shirts and want to start off as a hobby. It is also perfect for low quantities, single-color designs, and no complex designs. Second, we have direct-to-garment printing. This can be considered the second level, depending on your type of production. It does cost some money to get a basic machine, and it takes some time to learn. It has multiple steps that should be done carefully. Last but not least, we have Screen Printing. This is an older method of printing shirts, but it is still used for large productions. Most companies that produce large amounts daily use this method because it is practical and most cost-effective for the type of work they do. Buying all the equipment can cost quite a bit and requires a lot of learning. Now, you have learned of the three most common methods used to print shirts. There are many other methods out there, but these three are great for getting an idea of how to get started. Below, I have placed three different articles on how to get started with each. It will give you the equipment that can be used, step-by-step procedures, and tips. </p>
