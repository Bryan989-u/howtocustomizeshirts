                <div class="dtg4">This type of T-shirt printing is very similar to traditional printers. It has the capability of printing high-quality multicolor designs on a shirt. The upfront cost can be quite expensive, but there are multiple options to choose from to get the same results. This method would be recommended to individuals who are more experienced and have recurring orders.</div>
                <div>I’ll briefly explain different ways to get DTG results:</div>

            </div>  
            <ul class="dtglistequiptment1">
            <h3>First, you need your equipment: </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>100% cotton shirt </li>
                    <li>DTG printer </li>
                    <li>Digital Design Software </li>
                    <li>DTG Pretreatment Solution for light and/or dark garment  </li>
                    <li>Heat press </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="dtglistequiptment2"> 
        <h3>Now let’s get to printing:</h3>
        <ol class="dtglistequiptment3">
            <li>Create the design</li>
            <li>Upload the design to the DTG printer software</li>
            <li>Pre-treat the shirt. This is spraying the shirt with the solution. This helps the ink stick well and the colors to be brighter </li>
            <li>Load the shirt on the DTG printer. Make sure it’s properly aligned to where you want your design and wrinkle-free</li>
            <li>Once it’s loaded, print the shirt</li>
            <li>Now, the last step is to cure the shirt. All you must do is place it under the heat press for about 1 minute  </li>     
        </ol> 
        <p>You can use a method called print-on-demand. Essentially, a business would make the shirts for you and send them out to the customer. This process is very simple. First, you need to find a supplier, a company that does print-on-demand. (Printify and Printful are well known for this). Second, you can connect this to your website if you have one. It can also be connected to Etsy or similar sites that allow it. You, the owner, will have to create the design and do all the set-up so that orders can go through smoothly. The cycle starts with the customer, who will order from your site. Now, there are two options: you can either do it manually as in approve or deny orders, or you can do it in a way that it gets sent automatically to the supplier. Once the supplier gets the order, they will start printing the shirts. Once it is ready, they will pack it and send it to the customer. Now, there are advantages and disadvantages to this. Advantages: low to no up-front cost, takes less time to learn and make, no need for space or maintenance. Disadvantages: less profit margins, no control over quality or packaging, no control over shipping or turnaround time, and more product/supplier research required.</p>
