            <p>The order pages give a brief description of how to make shirts using HTV, DTG, and Screen-printing. We know it can be a lot. Especially if you work or have other responsibilities. But I will encourage you to at least try one of the methods. I believe it can be rewarding. You can do it for fun or as a side hustle, or you can even start a company like Dash Prints. It just depends on where your heart is when it comes to printing shirts. </p>But don’t worry if you don’t have the time or you just simply don’t find it as interesting; Dash Prints has you covered. Dash Prints is a custom printing shirt company in the DMV area.  They have worked with military organizations, non-profit organizations like churches, they have worked with restaurants, and even sports teams in Stafford. To say the least, they are trustworthy, provide great quality, and most importantly, they care about their customers. So, you can give them a try for all your custom needs. They don’t only work with T-shirts but all hoodies, hats, pants, polos, etc. They can do anything that comes to your mind or may fit your needs.<br> is very simple to order; you send them an email or fill out the contact information form, and they will get back to you within 24 hours. To expedite the process, you can even send all your information, such as what type of items you want (ex. Shirts, hoodies), quantity, colors, sizes, material, brand, design, and shipping address.
