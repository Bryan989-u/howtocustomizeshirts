            <h3>Let’s begin with the equipment: </h3>

            Now we can get to the steps:
            <br>
            Once you have all the main equipment, we can start! 
        </li>
        <ol>
            <ol class="container">
                <li class="text-content">

                        <ul class="listequipment4">
                            <li>
                                I added the link to buy a Cricut machine. It will come with different features, such as the software called Cricut Design Space. So, we will start off by making the design. The software usually comes with free designs that you can use. But if you would like to make your own for free you can use Canva (link to website). Just create an account and start designing away. If you are using Canva or other programs to create the design, make sure you are downloading the design transparent and with the highest quality. (TIP: When using Canva make sure to download a PNG file and set your design to 4000px X 4000px)
                            </li>
                            <li>The next step is to upload the design to the Cricut design space, or if you selected a design from the software, make sure to set it up properly.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li class="creating">Cutting the HTV</li>
                        <ul class="listequipment4">
                            <li>Once the design is set up properly and you have the dimensions, you will set up the HTV. The package for the Cricut machine should contain a sticky mat and other tools. You will cut the HTV according to the size of the design and place it on the sticky mat. (The HTV will most likely have to be 12 x 12 max). The shiny part of the HTV has been facing down. Once it is properly set up on the mat place it inside the cutting machine and cut away.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li class="creating">Weeding your design</li>
                        <ul class="listequipment4">
                            <li>Once the design is cut, it’s time to weed out the extra material. Make sure you are only taking out the material that is not part of your design.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li class="creating">Prepping shirts</li>
                        <ul class="listequipment4">
                            <li>It is good practice to take the wrinkles out of the shirts, so it doesn’t mess up the design. Iron your shirt or place it under the heat press.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li class="creating">Position your design</li>
                        <ul class="listequipment4">
                            <li>Next, you are going to place your design on the shirt. Make sure it is aligned with the collar and is straight. Once you feel confident with your placement set it down on a table.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li class="creating">Apply heat</li>
                        <ul class="listequipment4">
                            <li>Each vinyl should have instructions on the temperature and the time it should be placed under the heat. Follow the instructions and set your heat press. Once everything is set up, you will place the shirt on the heat press.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li class="creating">Peeling off HTV</li>
                        <ul class="listequipment4">
                            <li>Each vinyl may be different some are required to be taken off while hot and others while cold. So, follow those instructions as well and peel off the vinyl.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li class="creating">Final press</li>
                        <ul class="listequipment4">
                            <li>This final step may not be in the instructions, but it is good practice to heat press your shirt for a second time. This is done for a few reasons, to make sure it’s properly sticking to shirts, give it a matte look rather than shiny (makes it look like plastic), give a smoother feel, and lastly to make it feel better to the touch.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>And there you go! That is how you make a shirt at home using HTV. Very simple, inexpensive, and fun.</p>
